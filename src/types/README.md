# Types Directory

This is where you'll define TypeScript types and interfaces.

## Learning Path:

1. Start with basic types (User, Message, etc.)
2. Build complex interfaces (ChatSession, ApiResponse, etc.)
3. Create utility types and generics
4. Add API response types

## Tips:

- Use descriptive names for types
- Group related types in the same file
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use types for unions and primitives
