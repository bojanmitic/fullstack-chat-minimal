# Hooks Directory

This is where you'll create custom React hooks.

## Learning Path:

1. Start with simple hooks (useLocalStorage, useToggle, etc.)
2. Build state management hooks (useChat, useAuth, etc.)
3. Create API integration hooks (useApi, useWebSocket, etc.)

## Tips:

- Hooks should start with 'use' prefix
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Keep hooks focused on a single concern
- Return objects with descriptive property names
