# Components Directory

This is where you'll create your React components.

## Learning Path:

1. Start with simple components (Button, Input, etc.)
2. Build more complex components (ChatMessage, ChatInput, etc.)
3. Create page-level components (ChatInterface, etc.)

## Tips:

- Use TypeScript for better development experience
- Keep components small and focused on one responsibility
- Use props to make components reusable
